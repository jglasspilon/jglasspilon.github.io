<p><strong>Role</strong>: Framework Architect<br /><strong>Company</strong>: Astucemedia</p>

<p>
  A modular, event-driven Unity framework designed to power real-time interactive touchscreen experiences in broadcast environments. Built to support deterministic startup, dynamic content composition, and live data interaction while remaining flexible for designers and integrators.
</p>

<h3>Architecture Philosophy</h3>
<p>
  This framework was designed around <strong>predictability, modular ownership, and data-driven interaction</strong>.
  In live broadcast scenarios, interactive systems must boot reliably, respond instantly to user input, and remain adaptable under tight iteration constraints.
</p>

<p>
  The systems below demonstrate how these principles were applied across startup orchestration, content management, and interactive data binding. <span class="emphassis"><strong>Expand a card</strong></span> below to explore the design challenges, technical approach, and resulting impact.

              <p>
                Enabled responsive, real-time UI updates and interactions while preserving a clean, component-based workflow.

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Before ➙</strong> polling-based updates and duplicated interaction logic increased complexity.</li>

                <li>Designed a subscription-based data binding model.</li>
                <li>Implemented event-driven updates for UI and interaction systems.</li>
                <li>Supported plug-and-play binding components for designers.</li>
                <li>Provided manual and automatic update control for performance tuning.</li>

            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>
                Synchronizing UI and interaction logic with live or rapidly changing data often leads to polling-heavy systems, duplicated logic, and tightly coupled dependencies.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>
                Introduced an event-driven subscription model where components react only to relevant data changes. This removed the need for polling while giving designers flexible, component-based access to live data.
              </p>

              <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>
                Unity applications with multiple interconnected systems often suffer from non-deterministic startup behavior, race conditions, and fragile initialization order — issues that are unacceptable in live broadcast environments.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>
                Introduce a deterministic startup pipeline that initializes systems in a flexible yet defined sequence, ensuring each subsystem only activates once its dependencies are ready. This guarantees a stable and predictable runtime state.

              <h2>Outcome</h2>
              <p>
                Enabled rapid iteration and dynamic composition of interactive screens by abstracting out transition logic and keeping all content self contained and pluggable into the existing framework.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Before ➙</strong> content changes required code modifications and often introduced bugs to other content due to their tightly coupled nature.</li>
                <li><strong>After ➙</strong> interactive content reconfigured through data with minimal engineering involvement.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Designed a content management layer to control screen composition.</li>
                <li>Defined data-driven content definitions using JSON.</li>
                <li>Enabled runtime content switching and layout reconfiguration.</li>
                <li>Maintained separation between framework systems and show-specific logic.</li>

            <section>
              <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>
                Interactive touchscreen projects often hard-code content logic directly into scenes or scripts, making iteration slow and increasing the risk of regressions when layouts change. Iteration speed is key in high-paced, high-stakes environments such as live broadcast and any regression bugs or iteration speed hurdles affect development credibility and client satisfaction.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>
                Abstract out interactive content into modular units defined by data rather than code. The framework instantiates and manages content dynamically, allowing layouts and interactions to evolve without touching core systems.
              </p>
