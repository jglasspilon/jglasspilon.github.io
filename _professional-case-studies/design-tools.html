        "No-Code Data Binder System"<br>
        A reusable MVVM-based (Model-View-ViewModel) UI binding framework that eliminated hard-coded UI logic and reduced iteration time from days to hours.

              <h2>Outcome</h2>
              <p>
                Enabled designers to build and modify complex data-driven UI without touching code, reducing iteration cycles from days to hours while improving stability.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Before ➙</strong> days of development time with extra QA required to catch bugs and issues</li>
                <li><strong>After ➙</strong> hours of integration time with next to zero QA required since design and data modifications resulted in zero changes to code</li>
              </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Designed the code architecture for a component-based Data Binder system with a "No-code" requirement during implementation</li>
                <li>Determined and prioritized needed components with a focus on scalability</li>
                <li>Built modular, data-binder components for various unity UGUI components</li>
                <li>Built a single point of entry component for binding multiple data binder components to a single JSON payload exposed through a single, function call.</li>
                <li>Built a single point of entry component for generating data binder prefabs from JSON array data requiring a single function call upon implementation.</li>
              </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>
                Creating data-driven graphics generally involves the manual coding of data mapped to various serialized components.
                This makes the creation of graphics a very programmer-first approach and is not very agile.
              </p>
              <p>
                This also creates an ever-increasing code base to maintain as the graphics increase in scope and new graphics are created.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>
                Use an MVVM approach with reusable components that define which JSON fields to bind to UGUI elements. These binders connect to a parent Data Binder, which supplies JSON data from the graphic class. The graphic class interacts only with the parent binder, keeping binding logic abstracted and enabling rapid, code-free modifications once implemented.
              </p>

            <section>
              <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Abstracting out data binding logic vastly helps reduce code complexity and improve scalability</li>
                <li>
                  “No-Code” scalable systems like this allow for more agile development, reduced QA scope, and significantly
                  reduce code maintenance and the risk of introducing new bugs
                </li>
